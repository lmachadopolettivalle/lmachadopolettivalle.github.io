        <p>I am currently a Software Developer at Bloomberg L.P. working on the Client Technologies Internal
          Apps team.</p>

        <p>I graduated with a B.S. in Astrophysics from Yale, and completed my Senior Thesis with Professor
          <a href="http://www.astro.yale.edu/nagai/Welcome.html">Daisuke Nagai</a> on Cosmological
          Simulations of low-mass galaxy clusters.</p>

        <p>I am passionate about teaching, and spend my free time <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f27bh4CIky4&amp;list=PLLom0wCJlLFz_nsybvEMRPyZdOYopQmWV">watching
            lectures</a> and <a
            href="https://www.physics.umd.edu/perg/qm/qmcourse/NewModel/research/whatwork/index.htm">reading
            teaching-related articles</a> so I can one day teach someone Physics.</p>

        <p>I am an avid explorer of the intersection between Natural Sciences and Computer Science. Since my
          undergraduate career, I have been fascinated by how computer simulations of the real world can
          provide so much insight into how our Universe works, from the smallest realms of quantum
          mechanics to the vast, vast study of cosmology.</p>

        <p>When I am not coding or studying Physics, I spend my time dancing Ballroom, playing soccer,
          trying to get back into rock climbing, and traveling places I know and places I could never
          imagine existed.</p>
