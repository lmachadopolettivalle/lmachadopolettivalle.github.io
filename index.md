## SHAPing the Gas: Understanding Gas Shapes in Dark Matter Haloes with Interpretable Machine Learning

First-author peer-reviewed publication. Applied XGBoost and SHAPley values to obtain an interpretable regression model connecting gas 3D shapes to properties of their dark matter hosts. The results provide a powerful model for adding baryons to dark matter only simulations.

## Currently learning

I am currently building my own full-stack website as a learning project. I am exploring React and NextJS for the front-end, and NodeJS with Express for the backend.
