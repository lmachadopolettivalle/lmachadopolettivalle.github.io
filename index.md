## Full-Stack Software Engineering: Experience and Software Stack

During my time at Bloomberg L.P. (2018 - 2021), I worked as a full-stack engineer in the Internal Applications team. I used Javascript in the frontend (with a UI tool developed in house), and Python, C++ and Javascript in the backend, and SQL relational databases.

I also worked as a Python trainer, where I taught Test Driven Development and Python for Backend Development to 100+ new engineers.

I developed software for the inner source internal Python Guild, improving libraries used by our 5000+ developers.

I also attended the Bloomberg Machine Learning course, available [here](https://bloomberg.github.io/foml/#home).

## SHAPing the Gas: Understanding Gas Shapes in Dark Matter Haloes with Interpretable Machine Learning

First-author peer-reviewed publication, published to MNRAS. See the full article [on MNRAS](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/507/1/1468/6343038) and [on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12987).

Machine learning models become even more impressive if they are _interpretable_, specially if their parameters can provide intuition into complex systems. In this publication, I applied _SHAPley_ values to a _XGBoost_ regression model, to predict the 3D shapes of gas clouds based on their dark matter host properties.

The connection between gas and dark matter is a complicated but powerful metric in our understanding of the Universe, and this work helps us develop faster and more accurate simulations of this connection.

## Teaching Assistant: Numerical Analysis for Differential Equations, ETH Zurich

During 2022 and 2023, I was a Teaching Assistant at ETH Zurich for the Math BSc course on _Numerical Analysis_. See the course catalogue and materials [here](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~grsam/SS23/NAII/index.html). I received the ETH VMP Teaching Assistant Award based on student votes and feedback, as announced [here](https://math.ethz.ch/news-and-events/news/d-math-news/2022/07/ten-teaching-assistants-received-the-vmp-assistant-award.html).

## Currently learning

I am currently building my own full-stack website as a learning project. I am exploring React and NextJS for the frontend, and NodeJS with Express for the backend.
