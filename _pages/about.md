I am currently a Software Developer at Bloomberg L.P. working on the Client Technologies Internal Apps team.

I graduated with a B.S. in Astrophysics from Yale, and completed my Senior Thesis with Professor [Daisuke Nagai](http://www.astro.yale.edu/nagai/Welcome.html) on Cosmological Simulations of low-mass galaxy clusters.

I am passionate about teaching, and spend my free time [watching lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f27bh4CIky4&list=PLLom0wCJlLFz_nsybvEMRPyZdOYopQmWV){:target="\_blank"} and [reading teaching-related articles](https://www.physics.umd.edu/perg/qm/qmcourse/NewModel/research/whatwork/index.htm){:target="\_blank"} so I can one day teach someone Physics.

I am an avid explorer of the intersection between Natural Sciences and Computer Science. Since my undergraduate career, I have been fascinated by how computer simulations of the real world can provide so much insight into how our Universe works, from the smallest realms of quantum mechanics to the vast, vast study of cosmology.
