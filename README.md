# Luis Fernando's Personal Website

Source code for my [personal website](https://lmachadopolettivalle.github.io/), based on the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme developed by [Maruan Alshedivat](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mshediva/) (who also uses this template!).

Originally, **al-folio** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](http://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license).


## Using this Website template

To use this template, head over to the [original repo](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/blob/master/README.md) and follow their instructions!
